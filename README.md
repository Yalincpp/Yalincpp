## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is Yalin from Ankara, the Turkish capital. Born in 2010 in Ankara, currently a high school student. Some of my hobbies are C++ coding (how surprising), amateur radio since June 2025 (Callsign: TA2EHI, QTH: KM69KV, Sec. Calls: ON/TA2EHI, TA5/TA2EHI, TA7/TA2EHI).
I really like mini-games like Sudoku, 8-game, 15-game, apartments, etc. and writing some code about playing and solving them.
